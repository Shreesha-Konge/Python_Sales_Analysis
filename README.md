# Python_Sales_Analysis
This is a pyhton project to analyse sales of the products.
Here I used Python Pandas for Data cleaning,used Python matplotlib for visualizations to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data.

Business questions:
1) What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
2) What city sold the most product?
3) What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
4) What products are most often sold together?
5) What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
